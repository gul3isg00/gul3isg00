## üöÄ Key Projects & Experience

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of, with a focus on the technical challenges and architecture.

### The SocialLine *(Private Repo)*
*(Nov 2023 -)*

As the sole developer for The SocialLine, a start-up cross-platform event matchmaking app, I designed and built the entire system from the ground up.

* **Backend:** Built a high-performance backend in **Rust** featuring 7 interconnected servers.
* **Frontend:** Developed the cross-platform mobile app using **React Native**.
* **Infrastructure:** Integrated **MongoDB** for data storage and **AWS S3** for file storage.
* **Core Algorithm:** Implemented a **threaded, graph-based matchmaking algorithm** to ensure speed and accuracy. I also designed systems to prevent redundant data.
* **Leadership:** Beyond coding, I led internal meetings, managed stakeholder communications, researched and implemented GDPR compliance, and mentored a summer intern in React and full-stack development.

### 2. W3W Delivery Route Planning App *(On GitLab)*
*(Sep 2023 - Jun 2024)*

I served as the team leader for a project with **KerridgeCS**, directing the development of a delivery route planning app.

* **Project Management:** I directed the project using **Agile sprints** and handled all client communications.
* **Frontend Lead:** I led the front-end development in **React Native**.
* **Complex Features:** I personally built the app's most complex features, including:
    * API integration
    * Map-based satnav
    * Offline support
* **Problem Solving:** I led collaborative debugging sessions over Discord to solve difficult technical problems and successfully kept the project on track by adapting our workflow after a team member's departure.

* **BSc Computer Science**
* On track to achieve a **First class degree**.
* **Key Modules:** Developing Maintainable Software, Operating Systems & Concurrency, Languages and Computation, Systems & Architecture, Human AI Interaction.

## üé® Other Interests

When I'm not coding, I'm also interested in 3D Printing, Reptile Keeping, and Graphic Design.
* **Graphic Design:** My complex photo montage created with Adobe Photoshop was selected for a national art exhibition and I was featured in an interview for **Adobe's global MAX 2021 showcase**.
* **ESports:** I ran my college's ESports society, growing it to over 100 members and leading 3 of our teams to become national champions.
